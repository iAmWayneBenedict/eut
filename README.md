This website is created when I was in first year. The purpose of this website is to help the incoming first year IT students to have brief understanding with their subjects. This website is a requirement for our Human Computer Interaction subject and I was asigned as a developer and teamed with a UI designer to build the website from scratch.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project?

-   While building this project, I have learned the structures of html, css especially flexbox, positions, media queries, and keyframes, and this was my first project that utilized the use of javascript.
    What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
-   Back then this project was a challenge for me, because this was my first project that I was asigned with a UI designer and needs to meet the requirements set in the UI design. I had basic understanding of html and css since it was my second website project but in Javascript, I had no idea on how to use it.
-   To overcome those challenges, I eqquiped myself to learned how to google stuff, find the best way on how to solve things, and integrate what I found in my project.
