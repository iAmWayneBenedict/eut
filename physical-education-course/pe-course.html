                                        <li>Brush- weight on one foot, hit the floor with the ball or heel of the other foot (the free foot) after which that foot is lifted from the floor to any direction.</li>
                                        <li>Clockwise- like the motion of the hands of the clock. R shoulder is toward the center of an imaginary circle.</li>

                                        <li>Cut- to displace quickly one foot with the other, thus completely taking off the weight of the body from the displaced foot.</li>

This is of foreign origin and is used in many Philippine dances.</li>

                                            a Visayan term.
                                            </li>
                                        <li>Hop- a spring from one foot landing on the same foot in place or in any direction. The other
                                            foot may be raised in any direction (in front, in rear, sideward or across).
